           <p> Lake Kol-Suu sparkles bright blue, perched in the middle of high granite cliffs. Set at an altitude of 3,500 m, this lake is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful in the country. Although it attracts more and more visitors every year, its remoteness and the fact that a permit is required to access it, dissuades the majority of tourists. As you may have understood, the detour is well worth it, especially since the track to get there has been rebuilt recently.</p>

            <p> Canyon Skazka is proof that Kyrgyzstan's landscape is rich with diverse geographical landforms. It includes mountains, valleys, steppes, canyons and even deserts. Skazka, which means 'a fairytale' in Russian, is called so because locals were surprised to find this hidden gem on the way to the Kyrgyz pearl: the Issyk-kul Lake. Even locals started to enjoy this canyon as a tourist destination quite recently. But it is unpopulated not because it doesn't fascinate people, but because not many people know about it. So, I strongly recommend you to check out this Martian valley by yourself as colorful hills and bizarre shapes of the canyons are quite a spectacle!</p>
